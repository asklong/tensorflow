 InvalidArgumentError Assign requires shapes of both tensors to match. lhs shape= [3957] rhs shape= [5771]
 your old lable number is 5771, your new lable number is 3957. and your old check point is there, when you run the train model, your model
 will use the old check point(label 5571). so the solution is delete old check point file, run the process again.
