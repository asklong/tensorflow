debug:
when we set cnn numbers, we have to set in cnn.py and eval.py: evaluate(), 121 lines.
because in the eval file, we also need to set the cnn numbers to set the cnn structure.
in cnn.py file, we set the cnn number in the structure.
n_cnn=5
in train.py file, we set the n_cnn to 12 in line 40.



when we have python base64 decode incorrect padding:
http://www.jianshu.com/p/8bada95adac5
解决此问题的方法很简单，对base64解码的string补齐等号就可以了，如下代码：

def decode_base64(data):

    """Decode base64, padding being optional.

    :param data: Base64 data as an ASCII byte string

    :returns: The decoded byte string.

     """

    missing_padding=4-len(data)%4

ifmissing_padding:

    data+=b'='*missing_padding

returnbase64.decodestring(data)

#returnbase64.b64decode(data)






how to set training steps:
in file gup_train.py, in line 22, we set the max_steps to 50 or we could change the number to other smaller/larger numbers.


only use one attribute and 224*224 image:
go to gen_data, change label gengeater, select_attr=['color']
go to gen tfrecord, change image_size to 224, num_class to 1261
go to gen_tfrecord, channgel should be 4


when the input is not match with the input requested from the model:
we meet the error: reshape not right...., so we should check the size of the input picture and the channel number:
check size of the picture:
from PIL import Image
with Image.open(filepath) as img:
    width, height = img.size
    #check size is 224 * 224
    #check the channel number:
    len(image.split())



bug:  ValueError: Tensor("tower_0/fifo_queue_Dequeue:0", 
shape=(512, 224, 224, 3), dtype=float32, device=/device:GPU:0) 
must be from the same graph as 
Tensor("Variable:0", shape=(11, 11, 3, 96), dtype=float32_ref).

A TensorFlow computation, represented as a dataflow graph.
A Graph contains a set of tf.Operation objects, which represent units of computation; 
and tf.Tensor objects, which represent the units of data that flow between operations.



get the variable name and value from the check point:
from tensorflow.python.tools.inspect_checkpoint import print_tensors_in_checkpoint_file
print_tensors_in_checkpoint_file(file_name='./tmp/mdl_ckpt', tensor_name='', all_tensors=False)
details for the function: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/tools/inspect_checkpoint.py



transfer learning:

get the parametes from one model, and freeze the variables on the model: 
set trainable to False, and initializer as tensor: net_data["conv1"][0](this is a parameter from out side model)
def _pre_train_variable_on_cpu(name, initializer):
    with tf.device('/cpu:0'):
         var = tf.get_variable(name, initializer=initializer, trainable=False)
     return var
