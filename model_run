debug:
when we set cnn numbers, we have to set in cnn.py and eval.py: evaluate(), 121 lines.
because in the eval file, we also need to set the cnn numbers to set the cnn structure.
in cnn.py file, we set the cnn number in the structure.
n_cnn=5
in train.py file, we set the n_cnn to 12 in line 40.



how to set steps:
in file gup_train.py, in line 22, we set the max_steps to 50 or we could change the number to other smaller/larger numbers.


only use one attribute and 224*224 image:
go to gen_data, change label gengeater, select_attr=['color']
go to gen tfrecord, change image_size to 224, num_class to 1261
go to gen_tfrecord, channgel should be 4
