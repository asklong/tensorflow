debug:
when we set cnn numbers, we have to set in cnn.py and eval.py: evaluate(), 121 lines.
because in the eval file, we also need to set the cnn numbers to set the cnn structure.
in cnn.py file, we set the cnn number in the structure.
n_cnn=5
in train.py file, we set the n_cnn to 12 in line 40.



when we have python base64 decode incorrect padding:

解决此问题的方法很简单，对base64解码的string补齐等号就可以了，如下代码：

def decode_base64(data):

    """Decode base64, padding being optional.

    :param data: Base64 data as an ASCII byte string

    :returns: The decoded byte string.

     """

    missing_padding=4-len(data)%4

ifmissing_padding:

    data+=b'='*missing_padding

returnbase64.decodestring(data)

#returnbase64.b64decode(data)






how to set training steps:
in file gup_train.py, in line 22, we set the max_steps to 50 or we could change the number to other smaller/larger numbers.


only use one attribute and 224*224 image:
go to gen_data, change label gengeater, select_attr=['color']
go to gen tfrecord, change image_size to 224, num_class to 1261
go to gen_tfrecord, channgel should be 4


when the input is not match with the input requested from the model:
we meet the error: reshape not right...., so we should check the size of the input picture and the channel number:
check size of the picture:
from PIL import Image
with Image.open(filepath) as img:
    width, height = img.size
    #check size is 224 * 224
    #check the channel number:
    len(image.split())
